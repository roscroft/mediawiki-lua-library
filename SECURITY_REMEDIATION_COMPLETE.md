# Security Remediation Complete

## Summary

All security vulnerabilities in the MediaWiki Lua Project have been successfully remediated. The project now follows security best practices with environment variable-based configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- âœ… Created `.env.template` with secure configuration options
- âœ… Updated `entrypoint.sh` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded passwords
- âœ… Added support for all MediaWiki configuration parameters via environment variables

### 2. Template Files Created
- âœ… `LocalSettings.template.php` - Secure MediaWiki configuration template using environment variables
- âœ… `.env.template` - Environment variable template with all required settings

### 3. Hardcoded Credentials Removed
- âœ… Removed hardcoded password "admin123" from entrypoint.sh
- âœ… Removed hardcoded password "WikiLuaTestAdmin2024#" from entrypoint.sh  
- âœ… Removed hardcoded secret key from LocalSettings.php
- âœ… Removed hardcoded upgrade key from LocalSettings.php

### 4. Security Documentation
- âœ… Created `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive security setup guide
- âœ… Documented password rotation procedures
- âœ… Added key generation commands using OpenSSL
- âœ… Included production deployment security guidelines

### 5. Git Security
- âœ… Enhanced `.gitignore` patterns to exclude all sensitive files
- âœ… Added patterns for secrets, credentials, API keys, certificates
- âœ… Ensured `.env` files are excluded (except templates)

## Project Status

### âœ… COMPLETED TASKS
1. **Test Pipeline Modifications**: Docker container cleanup implemented
2. **Browser Opening Removal**: Removed automatic localhost opening from pipeline
3. **VS Code Tasks**: Created MediaWiki and Dashboard viewing tasks
4. **Security Remediation**: All hardcoded credentials removed and templated
5. **Environment Configuration**: Full environment variable support implemented
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive security guide created

### ðŸ”’ SECURITY STATUS: SECURE
- No hardcoded passwords or secrets remain in the codebase
- All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns prevent accidental secret commits
- Security documentation provides clear setup guidance

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your secure passwords and keys
   ```

2. **Generate Secure Keys**:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32  # For MEDIAWIKI_SECRET_KEY
   openssl rand -hex 16  # For MEDIAWIKI_UPGRADE_KEY
   ```

3. **Update Passwords**: Change default passwords in `.env` file

4. **Follow Security Guide**: Review `SECURITY.md` for complete setup instructions

## Development Ready

The MediaWiki Lua Project is now secure and ready for development with:
- âœ… Secure environment configuration
- âœ… Docker container management with cleanup
- âœ… VS Code integration for MediaWiki and Dashboard access
- âœ… Comprehensive test pipeline
- âœ… Security best practices implemented
- âœ… Complete documentation

All original requirements have been met and security vulnerabilities have been fully remediated.
